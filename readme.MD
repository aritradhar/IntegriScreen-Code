This repo is for code related to IntegriScreen.

The goal of the project is to ensure the integrity of user’s communication with a trusted server
using an untrusted client by relying on a trusted mobile device.
The mobile device uses visual analysis of client’s screen and input devices to assert that user’s
indented actions match the data received by the server.
